## **About me**
  My name is Anton and I am 30. The year 2022 has made changes in my life so I decided to change my profession.
  I have 8 years of work experience in sales. Past 3 years I have been working remotely as a sales manager.
  I relocated to another county and started learning Python but the situation has changed and now I am learning JavaScript.
  Web development for me is a new challenge, however it is interesting and gives a lot of opportunities to improve my skills as a web developer
  and of course my personality which is also significant. My strengths are to be a team player, to deal with people, accuracy.
  My life goal is self-development.
